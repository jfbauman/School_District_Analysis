# School_District_Analysis
Anaconda Python Jupiter Notebook

After analyzing the standardized testing data for the city school district, I was able to find out a few things. I found that the average reading score was 72 and the average math score was 64 showing that overall the students did better in the reading portion. The data also showed that the Charter schools had higher math scores in grades 9, 10 & 11 and the Public schools had higher reading scores for grades 9-12 on average. Lastly I discovered that the school with a highest budget had highest scores in math and reading.
